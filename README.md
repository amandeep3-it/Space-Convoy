# Space Convoy - Ada

Command-line based Graphical Ada Space Convoy Designs to enhance and develop communication and networking skills. Learning goals were to practise the airships' effective interactions with the fuel ball and several other airships. The design should keep alive as many ships as possible by allowing them to access the fuel ball when appropriate.

## Description

The airships of the program are to assign each other in accessing the fuel ball to keep themselves alive as much as possible. The design `2 Circles Model` contains the airships forming a 2 circles circulation path next to the fuel ball. The design `Sphere Model` contains the airships forming a sphere circulation path around the fuel ball.
